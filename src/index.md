"The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog. A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer. He will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If fortune drives the master forth, an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by the graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death."

George Graham Vest - c. 1855

Laika, once a random Russian stray became world famous when she took off on her mission into outer space aboard *Sputnik 2* on November 3, 1957 â€“ from which she would never return. 

Soviet engineers never planned for Laika to survive her filght, expecting her to die from oxygen deprivation after seven days in space. They only provided her with one meal, in hopes of keeping *Sputnik 2* within it weight limit. She was not the only dog chosen for the mission either, Albina, another stray was also fitted for the mission similar to Laika. Albina was originally chosen, however, she had gained the affection of her keepers which saved from the fatal flight. Even Laika's keepers were not entirely heartless, as just days before her flight Vladimir Yazdovsky took her home for a bit to "do something nice for the dog." 

As the first ever living creature to orbit Earth, Laika was nothing but extrodinary. However, her story is one that we cannot forget for more than one reason. Laika's journey into space was cruel and she was terrified. Her death was a tragedy that could have been avoided if animal rights were just as important as our own, which she reminds us to strive for everyday.
